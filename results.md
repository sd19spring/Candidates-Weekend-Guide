After six weeks of meetings, git commits, and breaking each others' code, we are happy to share the Candidates' Weekend Guide with you.

![Welcome](/photos/IMG_0846.png)

The Candidates' Weekend Guide is the electronic substitute for the paper handouts presented at Olin College's Candidates' Weekend.

After successfully logging in to the site, the candidate gets access to their personalized Candidates' Weekend schedule as well as their Candidate information - information typically given to students on the back of their name tags when they arrive to campus.

Events also have their own personal pages that have further information.

Parents all have one generic login that allows them to see which events are available for them to attend.

On the Administrator side, the schedules can be easily updated to reflect changes in events for each of the three weekends.
