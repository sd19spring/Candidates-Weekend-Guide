# History

In past Candidates' Weekends, Olin College of Engineering would print out fliers for schedules and different events and place them in a folder for each student with extras for parents. In an attempt to go paperless, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid decided to use Guidebook, an app for organizing events. Guidebook was useful, but costly since each download of the app charged the college five dollars. It was not worth the five dollars since the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid turned off many of the features, reducing the app to its simplest form.

# Goals

Before we decided on this project, we knew one of our goals would be to create something that lasted beyond the end of this final project for Software Design. Upon deciding on this project, we determined another goal was to help Admissions go paperless in the name of environmental sustainability, and to help the Admissions office save money.
