# Software Impact

We created this web app with the overarching goal of helping Olin College Admissions - our way of giving back to a college that we love.

As with any piece of software, big or small, we considered the ethical implications of our work.

We wanted to personalize the students' experience with the app without compromising their personal information. To do this, we utilized password encryption. This way, both the students' privacy and security are protected. We also store minimal information about each candidate; only the information that is relevant to their Candidates' Weekend is stored in the database, like their Design Challenge group and interview time. The administrators on the app do not have access to user passwords, further protecting the students' privacy.

We also want to make this app accessible to everyone - that's why we created a product that is web-based as opposed to a standalone app. Access to the app is not limited by the type of device a user has. Anyone with an internet connection can use our site and interact with it. We wanted to be as inclusive with the Candidates' Weekend Guide as Olin College is to its candidates.

We aim to continue to improve the accessibility of the Candidates' Weekend Guide. Future versions of the app will support individuals with color-blindness and low/impaired visibility with more readable text and color schemes so that everyone can enjoy Candidates' Weekend to its fullest.

# Data Usage
Data generated and stored within the Candidates' Weekend Guide is quite minimal. Candidates' Weekend Guide has not and will not sell any of its personal data to anyone. The data stored is also temporary. Every year, the data is wiped so that only the current candidates have access to the weekend information. By using the site, you accept our terms and conditions. Should anything happen, the Candidates' Weekend Guide team is not liable.
